## Overview
* In this project a simple Python based web application will be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.
* We make use of Helm to deploy this app to K8s.
* This web app also exposes some metrics using the Prometheus Python client.
* To store and visualize these metrics we will deploy Prometheus and Grafana in the K8s cluster.
* We will deploy and use an ingress controller for exposing the web app, Prometheus, and Grafana to external users.
* TODO - Logging
